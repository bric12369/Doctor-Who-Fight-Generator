Doctor Who Fight Generator
==========================

## Description ##
This program generates a fight between Doctor Who characters in a Doctor Who location by choosing a goody, a baddie and a location, and logging the results to console.
##	How it works ##
The program uses JavaScript's Math.random() to select random elements from pre-defined arrays. I decided to create a helper function to handle the randomisationâ€”that way, I could pass each array (goodies, baddies, and locations) in as arguments in separate functions rather than using the Math.random method multiple times. Finally, I created another function that logs the results of the other functions to the console.
##	Technologies ##
I developed this project using Javascript, using Node to monitor my progress and Git to version control along the way.
